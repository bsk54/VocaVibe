Description: cSpeak is a single-page web application designed for studying **vocabulary in any language**. After loading a list of **entries** separated by **`#` or TAB** (two columns for most languages; three columns for Chinese—**Hanzi, Pinyin, and translation**), each entry appears as a numbered card displaying only the word or phrase **in your target language**. An arrow in the corner toggles the card open or closed to reveal or hide the definition. Every time you toggle, the word’s pronunciation plays. Clicking anywhere else on the card simply pronounces the word without changing its open state. You can manage multiple vocabulary lists via the dropdown menu, switch speech languages in the ☰ menu, and save, restore, or export your data. All of this is backed by **`localStorage`**.
